    <p> <b>Chicken</b> <i>(Gallus gallus domesticus)</i>, a subspecies of the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a>, is a type of domesticated fowl. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] 
    There are more <b>chickens</b> in the world than any other bird.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).[3][4]</p>
    
    <p> Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]</p>
    
    <p> There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.</p>

        <p>Chicken once referred to young domestic fowl in general. The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The "hen and chickens" was also a name for the pentacycle, an early design of cargo cycle which had a large central driving wheel surrounded by four small stabiliser wheels.</p>
